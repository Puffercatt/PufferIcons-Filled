# PufferIcons Filled

PufferIcons is fork of Rkicons, a fork Lawnicons which is an add-on for adding themed icons to [Lawnchair 12 Alpha 5](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair) and above.
This addon is now the source of all themed icons, for simplicity.

PufferIcons Filled as well as Rkicons are filled while PufferIcons and Lawnicons are outlined.
